Please first identify the logo within the image from the company name that you know.
The logo usually includes the company's name, usually a symbol right next to it, but no other text or images.

Only analyze the company name and small symbols next to it, ignore ALL TEXT, that is NOT the company's name, ignore the entire rest of the image!

- Use the full list of hex codes provided in the color palette (including secondary ones).
- Check if the logo's colors are from this palette, but ACCEPT SMALL DEVIATIONS from the actual codes, as well as gradients.
- Return 1 if the logo colors approximately match the palette; 0 otherwise.
- If unsure, make your best guess.
